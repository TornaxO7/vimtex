Vim\+TeX is developed mainly through the master branch, and pull requests should be \href{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/}{\texttt{ fork based}}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Documentation style}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md2}
Vim help files have their own specific syntax. There is a Vim help section on how to write them, see \href{http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/helphelp.html\#help-writing}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily \+:h help-\/writing}}}.

The Vim\+TeX documentation style should be relatively clear, and it should be easy to see from the existing documentation how to write it. Still, here are some pointers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Max 80 columns per line
\item Use the help tag system for pointers to other parts of the Vim documentation
\item Use line of {\ttfamily =}s to separate sections
\item Use line of {\ttfamily -\/}s to separate subsections
\item The section tags should be right aligned at the 79th column
\item Sections should be included and linked to from the table of contents
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Code style}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md3}
When submitting code for Vim\+TeX, please adhere to the following standards\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use {\ttfamily shiftwidth=2} -\/ no tabs!
\item Write readable code
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Break lines for readability
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Line should not be longer than 80 columns
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Use comments\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For complex code that is difficult to understand
\item Simple code does not need comments
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Use (single) empty lines to separate logical blocks of code
\item Use good variable names
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name should indicate what the variable is/does
\item Variable names should be lower case
\item Local function variables should be preceded with {\ttfamily l\+:}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Prefer single quoted strings
\item See also the \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/vimscriptguide.xml}{\texttt{ Google vimscript style guide}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Use markers for folding
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I generally only fold functions, and I tend to group similar functions so that when folded, I get a nice structural overview of a file
\item See some of the files for examples of how I do this
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Running tests}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}
New functionality should be accompanied by tests. Tests can be run from the {\ttfamily test} folder with {\ttfamily make}. The tests currently only run on Linux, and the following utilities are required to run all the tests\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily wget}
\item {\ttfamily chronic} (from \href{https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/}{\texttt{ moreutils}})
\end{DoxyItemize}

These utilities may not come with all Linux distributions and may need to be installed with your favorite package manager (e.\+g. {\ttfamily yum}, {\ttfamily apt-\/get}, or {\ttfamily brew} on Mac).

By default, the tests are run with the Neovim executable {\ttfamily nvim}. You can change the executable by setting the environment variable {\ttfamily MYVIM} before running. To run with vanilla vim, use {\ttfamily MYVIM=\char`\"{}vim -\/\+T dumb -\/-\/not-\/a-\/term -\/-\/noplugin -\/n\char`\"{}}. Either export this in your shell, or prepend to {\ttfamily make}, that is, run {\ttfamily MYVIM=\char`\"{}vim -\/\+T dumb -\/-\/not-\/a-\/term -\/-\/noplugin -\/n\char`\"{} make}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}
Vim\+Tex provides a little high-\/level \mbox{\hyperlink{md_DOCUMENTATION}{documentation}}. It\textquotesingle{}s still under development, but it might help you to understand the code better. If you have any question about the code, feel free to open a new issue!
