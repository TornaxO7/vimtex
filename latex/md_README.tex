Vim\+TeX is a modern \href{http://www.vim.org/}{\texttt{ Vim}} and \href{https://neovim.io/}{\texttt{ neovim}} filetype and syntax plugin for La\+TeX files.

Vim\+TeX requires Vim version 8.\+0.\+1453 or neovim version 0.\+4.\+3. The requirements were updated in July 2020 after the release of Vim\+TeX 1.\+0. If you are stuck on older versions of Vim or neovim, then you should not use the most recent version of Vim\+TeX, but instead remain at the v1.\+0 tag.

Some features require external tools. For example, the default compiler backend relies on \href{http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/}{\texttt{ latexmk}}. Users are encouraged to read the requirements section in the \href{doc/vimtex.txt}{\texttt{ documentation}} ({\ttfamily \+:h vimtex-\/requirements}).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md38}
If you use \href{https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug}{\texttt{ vim-\/plug}}, then add the following line to your {\ttfamily vimrc} file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Plug 'lervag/vimtex'}

\end{DoxyCode}


Or use some other plugin manager\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/gmarik/vundle}{\texttt{ vundle}}
\item \href{https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim}{\texttt{ neobundle}}
\item \href{https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen}{\texttt{ pathogen}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you use the new package feature in Vim, please note the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure to read and understand the package feature\+: {\ttfamily \+:help package}!
\item Use the {\ttfamily /pack/foo/start} subdirectory to make sure the filetype plugin is automatically loaded for the {\ttfamily tex} filetypes.
\item Helptags are not generated automatically. Run {\ttfamily \+:helptags} to generate them.
\item Please note that by default Vim puts custom {\ttfamily /start/} plugin directories at the end of the {\ttfamily \&runtimepath}. This means the built in filetype plugin is loaded, which prevents Vim\+TeX from loading. See \href{https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1413}{\texttt{ \#1413}} for two suggested solutions to this. To see which scripts are loaded and in which order, use {\ttfamily \+:scriptnames}.
\item For more information on how to use the Vim native package solution, see \href{https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it}{\texttt{ here}} and \href{https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/}{\texttt{ here}}.

The following is a simple guide for how to use Vim\+TeX. It only displays the most basic features. Users are {\itshape strongly} encouraged to read or at least skim through the documentation to learn about the different features and possibilities provided by Vim\+TeX (see \href{doc/vimtex.txt}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily \+:h vimtex}}}).

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md40}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md40}
Below is a list of features offered by Vim\+TeX. The features are accessible as both commands and mappings. The mappings generally start with {\ttfamily $<$localleader$>$l}, but if desired one can disable default mappings to define custom mappings. All features are enabled by default, but each feature may be disabled if desired.

{\ttfamily  The following are some alternative La\+TeX plugins for Vim\+:}

{\ttfamily 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net}{\texttt{ La\+Te\+X-\/\+Suite}}

The main difference between Vim\+TeX and La\+Te\+X-\/\+Suite (aka vim-\/latex) is probably that Vim\+TeX does not try to implement a full fledged IDE for La\+TeX inside Vim. E.\+g.\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Vim\+TeX does not provide a full snippet feature, because this is better handled by \href{https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips}{\texttt{ Ulti\+Snips}} or \href{https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim}{\texttt{ neosnippet}} or similar snippet engines.
\item Vim\+TeX builds upon Vim principles\+: It provides text objects for environments, inline math, it provides motions for sections and paragraphs
\item Vim\+TeX uses {\ttfamily latexmk}, {\ttfamily latexrun}, {\ttfamily tectonic} or {\ttfamily arara} for compilation with a callback feature to get instant feedback on compilation errors
\item Vim\+TeX is very modular\+: if you don\textquotesingle{}t like a feature, you can turn it off.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box}{\texttt{ La\+Te\+X-\/\+Box}}

Vim\+TeX currently has most of the features of La\+Te\+X-\/\+Box, as well as some additional ones. See \href{\#features}{\texttt{ here}} for a relatively complete list of features.

One particular feature that La\+Te\+X-\/\+Box has but Vim\+TeX misses, is the ability to do single-\/shot compilation {\itshape with callback}. This functionality was removed because it adds a lot of complexity for relatively little gain (IMHO).
